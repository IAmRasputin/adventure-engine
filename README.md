# adventure-engine
A command line toy for writing, reading, and sharing CYOA-type stories.

At present, it's just a simple text editor that can't actually edit files.  I'll be adding functionality 
whenever I have time.

# 0.1.0 feature wishlist
* Open, edit, and save files from the editor
* Have text respond to boundaries of terminal (auto word-wrap, scrolling)
* Main menu
* Seperate mode for reading story files
* Working standard for story files
